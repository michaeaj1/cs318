    <h3> Q: Can I approve my Fireteam before all open spots are taken?</h3>
        <p class="answer">A: Yes. If the Fireteam is ready to be created, but not all of the open spots have been filled, the author may select the "Prematurely Close Thread and Create Fireteam" button which will lock the topic and Fireteam members.</p>

    <h3>Q: How can I communicate with my Fireteam prior to meeting in-game?</h3>
        <p class="answer">A: Once a Fireteam has been approved, all participants will receive a notification on Bungie.net and the Destiny Mobile Companion App which will automatically open up a chat for all participants. Here, information may be shared in private so that players may connect in Destiny.

            NOTE: Once a player leaves a chat, they cannot rejoin without creating a new one. If players find that they enjoyed their experience with a Fireteam, it is encouraged to not leave the chat so that they may resume communication with those players at any time.</p>

    <h3>Q: Can I edit a Recruitment topic after I have Approved my Fireteam?</h3>
        <p class="answer">A: No. Players can not edit the drop down selections of a Recruitment topic after it has been approved or cancelled, however the Title and Body may still be edited. If a player wishes to further change a topic, or wishes to continue recruiting after the thread has been closed, an entirely new topic will need to be created.</p>
