            <p class="text">I live here, that is about the extent of my knowledge. There is a water tower, a farm, bars, churches, and people live here. If there was more to say, I would say more.</p>
            
            <p class="text"> So if I have nothing to say why do I have a second paragraph you may ask? Well it is because it is more aestetically pleasing. So here I am just typing in some words to make it seem like there is more information that I can give you. However, as the previous paragraph has already stated, I have very little left to say. Eleva is in Wisconsin. There, I wrote some more acutal information. Yay!</p>
