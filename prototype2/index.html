                Welcome to Snowy Rose Creations! Where  all of our scarves are homemade and resonably priced. At Snowy Rose Creations you can expect that the scarf that you are purchasing is only slightly above the cost of materials which is the point of Snowy Rose Creations. For Kaitlyn it is not about gaining profit, but rather to fund an activity that helps manage her stress and anxiety. However, due to this she does not take any custome order requests with a deadline. If you do make a custom order let it be known that it takes her a while to make the scarf as well as find the color and thickness of yarn you requested. If you do find a design that you like, and would like her to make it, feel free to email the pattern to her, but the same stipulations apply. She will finish it when she can and let you know.
            </p>

                The reason she does not do custome orders with deadlines is due to stress. It is also due to the fact that she cannot work on any items for more than an hour a day due to problems with her wrists. Otherwise, she does keep a steady stock of scarves available for purchase in all shapes, sizes and colors. We hope you enjoy what she has to offer! Thank you for visiting Snowy Rose Creations!
